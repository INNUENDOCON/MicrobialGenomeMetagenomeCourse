# Working group bacterial genomics, part 3

1) annotate all the assemblies with *prokka* and cluster genes in groups of orthologs using *roary*
> with *-i* flag in *roary* you can decide the minimum percentage identity for blastp (default *95%*); do you think this value is appropriate for your dataset? 

**Note**: since your dateset is very small for performing GWAS, you will select a set of few accessory genes
