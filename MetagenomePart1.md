# Metagenome analysis of bird feces dataset
Log into Taito, either with ssh (Mac/Linux) or PuTTy (Windows)  
# Data download
First set up the course directory, make some folders and then download the data.  
Move to work directory at CSC and make a course directory there. Or a subfolder under a previous course folder.  
```
cd $WRKDIR
mkdir BioInfo_course
cd BioInfo_course
mkdir raw_data
mkdir scripts
mkdir trimmed_data
```

Download the metagenomic data (takes few minutes)  
```
cd raw_data
*detailes given on Wed*
tar -xzvf course_metagenomes.tar.gz
```
The md5 sum for the file is #XXXXX#. Check that the md5 um for the file you downloaded matches by typing
```
md5sum filename
```

Make a file containing the sample names to be used later in bash scripts.  
 `ls *.fastq.gz |awk -F "-" '{print $2}'|uniq > ../sample_names.txt`  

# QC and trimming
QC for the raw data (takes few min, depending on the allocation).  
Go to the folder that contains the raw data, load the biokit module and make a folder called e.g. `FASTQC` for the QC reports.  
Then run the QC for the raw data and combine the results to one report using `multiqc`.  
Can be done on the interactive nodes using `sinteractive`. In that case use only 4 threads in the `fastqc` step.  
```
# allocate the computing resources and log in to the computing node. 
salloc -n 1 --cpus-per-task=6 --mem=3000 --nodes=1 -t 00:30:00 -p serial
srun --pty $SHELL
# activate the QC environment
source activate QC_env
# Run fastqc 
fastqc ./*.fastq.gz -o FASTQC/ -t 6
# Then combine the reports with multiqc
multiqc ./ --interactive
# deactivate the virtual env
source deactivate
# log out from the computing node 
exit
# and free the resources after the job is done
exit
```

Copy the resulting HTML file to your local machine with `scp` from the command line (Mac/Linux) or *WinSCP* on Windows.  
Have a look at the QC report with your favorite browser.  

After inspecting the output, it should be clear that we need to do some trimming.  

Make a folder for the trimmed data.  
Then we'll make a bash script that runs cutadapt for each file using the `sample_names.txt` file.    
Go to your scripts folder and make a bash script for cutadapt with any text editor. Specify the adapter sequences that you want to trim after `-a` and `-A`.  
Option `-q` is for quality trimming (PHRED score).  
Check that the paths are correct.  
Cutadapt [manual.](http://cutadapt.readthedocs.io)  
```
#!/bin/bash

while read i
do
        cutadapt  -a ADAPTER -A ANOTHER_ADAPTER -q 28 -O 10 \
        -o ../trimmed_data/$i"_R1_trimmed.fastq" -p ../trimmed_data/$i"_R2_trimmed.fastq" \
        *$i*_R1*.fastq.gz *$i*_R2*.fastq.gz > ../trimmed_data/$i"_trim.log"
done < $1
```
Then we need a batch job file to submit the job to the SLURM system. More about CSC batch jobs here: https://research.csc.fi/taito-batch-jobs  
Make another file with text editor.
```
#!/bin/bash -l
#SBATCH -J cutadapt
#SBATCH -o cutadapt_out_%j.txt
#SBATCH -e cutadapt_err_%j.txt
#SBATCH -t 01:00:00
#SBATCH -n 1
#SBATCH -p serial
#SBATCH --mem=50
#

module load biokit
cd $WRKDIR/BioInfo_course/raw_data
bash ../scripts/cutadapt.sh ../sample_names.txt
```
After it is done, we can submit it to the SLURM system. Do it form the main folder, so go one step back in your folders.  

`sbatch scripts/cut_batch.sh`  

You can check the status of your job with:  

`squeue -l -u $USER`  

After the job has finished, you can see how much resources it actually used and how many billing units were consumed. `JOBID` is the number after the batch job error and output files.  

`seff JOBID`  

Then let's check the results from the trimming. Go to the folder containing the trimmed reads and make a new folder for the QC files.  
Allocate some resources and then run FASTQC and MultiQC again.  
```
salloc -n 1 --cpus-per-task=6 --mem=3000 --nodes=1 -t 00:30:00 -p serial
srun --pty $SHELL
# activate the QC environment
source activate QC_env
# run QC on the trimmed reads
fastqc ./*.fastq -o FASTQC/ -t 6
 multiqc ./ --interactive
# deactivate the virtual env
source deactivate
# log out from the computing node 
exit
# and free the resources after the job is done
exit
```

Copy it to your local machine as earlier and look how well the trimming went.  

# Assembly
Let's assemble first one seagull sample and one goose sample an then all six samples together (co-assembly). We will use tool Megahit for the assembly https://github.com/voutcn/megahit. Megahit is an ultra fast assembly tool for metagenomics data. It is installed to CSC and be loaded with following commands:

```
module purge
module load intel/16.0.0
module load megahit
```
module purge is needed to remove wrong Pyhton versions you might have loaded in earlier today.

Assembling metagenomic data can be very resource demanding and we need to do it as a batch job. As we want to do both individual and co-assemblies the R1 and R2 reads need to be merged into two files with `cat`

```
cd trimmed_data
cat *R1_trimmed.fastq > all_R1_trimmed.fastq
cat *R2_trimmed.fastq > all_R2_trimmed.fastq
```
Make a script called co_assembly.sh in a text editor
```
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -J megahit
#SBATCH -o megahit_out_%j.txt
#SBATCH -e megahit_err_%j.txt
#SBATCH -t 06:00:00
#SBATCH -n 1
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=16
#SBATCH --mem=20000
#

module purge
module load intel/16.0.0
module load megahit

megahit -1 trimmed_data/all_R1_trimmed.fastq -2 trimmed_data/all_R2_trimmed.fastq \
         -o co-assembly -t $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK --min-contig-len 1000

# MetaQUAST assembly statistics
module purge
module load biokit
cd co-assembly
metaquast.py -t $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK --no-plots -o assembly_QC final.contigs.fa 
```
Submit the batch job as previously

# Taxonomic profiling with Metaxa2
The microbial community profiling for the samples will be done using a 16S/18S rRNA gene based classification software [Metaxa2](http://microbiology.se/software/metaxa2/).  
It identifies the 16S/18S rRNA genes from the short reads using HMM models and then annotates them using BLAST and a reference database.
We will run Metaxa2 as an array job in Taito. More about array jobs at CSC [here](https://research.csc.fi/taito-array-jobs).  

Make a folder for Metaxa2 results and direct the results to that folder in your array job script. (Takes ~6 h for the largest files)
```
#!/bin/bash -l
#SBATCH -J metaxa
#SBATCH -o metaxa_out_%A_%a.txt
#SBATCH -e metaxa_err_%A_%a.txt
#SBATCH -t 10:00:00
#SBATCH --mem=10000
#SBATCH --array=1-6
#SBATCH -n 1
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=6
#SBATCH -p serial

cd $WRKDIR/BioInfo_course/Metaxa2
# Metaxa uses HMMER3 and BLAST, so load the biokit first
module load biokit
# each job will get one sample from the sample names file stored to a variable $name
name=$(sed -n "$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID"p ../sample_names.txt)
# then the variable is used in running metaxa2
metaxa2 -1 ../trimmed_data/$name"_R1_trimmed.fastq" -2 ../trimmed_data/$name"_R2_trimmed.fastq" \
            -o $name --align none --graphical F --cpu $SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK --plus
metaxa2_ttt -i $name".taxonomy.txt" -o $name
```
