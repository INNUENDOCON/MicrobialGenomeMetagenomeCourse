# Working group bacterial genomics, part 2

Today the group work is divided in two sessions: 1) evaluation of the assemblies and in silico prediction of the antibiotic resistance genes; 2) schema creation and allele-calling. The first session will be during lunch time and the second from 16:00 to 17:00 after the **chewBBACA** session.

## Session (1)

1) evaluate the quality of the assemblies inspecting *combine_samples_reports* and *samples_report* outfile of **INNUca**
> did all the samples pass the QA/QC?
